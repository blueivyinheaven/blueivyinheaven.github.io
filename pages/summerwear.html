		<ul>
			<li>For tall people avoid wearing vertical list as they will make you look taller</li>
			
			<li>And for chubby people you should wear clothes with vertical lines as they encourage the eyes to move up and down and the person looks thinner </li>
			<li>Light clothes make people look darker than their usual complexion so they (dark people)should wear dark clothes</li>
